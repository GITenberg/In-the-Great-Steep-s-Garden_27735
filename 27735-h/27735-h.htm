<h2>The Hill People.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their steps are light and exceedingly fleet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass me by in the hurrying street.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I pause to look at a window&rsquo;s show&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the white-flecked alp the hill winds blow&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all at once it has passed me there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilting back to the land of the air,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back to the land of the great white stills:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it only the wind that comes down from the hills?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was it Pikes Peak Pixie or Cheyenne Shee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whispered a gay little rhyme to me?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or a gnome that lives in the heart of a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dances at dawn around Cameron&rsquo;s Cone?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did the haunting laugh of the Maid of the Corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Aztec memory trill on the morn?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or soft did the Navajo Shell-Woman speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she passed with a hymn for the great white peak?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They touch me light with their finger tips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay little snatches of song on my lips,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And swift I am gone where the hill-streams flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the pit-lark soars and the gentians blow.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tapers of blossoms flame under the tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pilgrim road unfolds for me,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lifting away where the hill-folk keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gardens and cloisters and shrines of the Steep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In charmed ways my feet are set:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what fair host is the palmer met<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And borne away to the great white stills?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it only the wind that comes down from the hills?<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A carnival gladdens the hills in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Columbine waltzes a gypsy tune;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deep in the pleasance, happily met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She whirls with a gay little pirouette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the long trees lean in a twilight trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming her over the seas to France.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Or quiet under the aspen&rsquo;s shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Misty-eyed little pensive maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Musing under the Great Steep&rsquo;s tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is it for Pierrot?&mdash;where is he?<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A flutter of petticoats, buff and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sashes and streamers and holiday tire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Columbine trips her a measure for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gayest heart of the waltzing choir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the pines I saw her dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lilting a gay little tune of France.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">On a maiden wondrously fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw her first in the Cashmere&rsquo;s danks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing at dawn by a river&rsquo;s banks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O night of sorrow in Cashmere&rsquo;s fen&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till the river-maid&rsquo;s hand shall scatter and pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seeds of the little blue flowers she wore,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Love&rsquo;s handmaid has passed this way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did the long miles fret or the red suns beat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did the great stones tear at her little white feet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did the storm winds harry with stinging sleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or the mad seas bid her stay?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ah, Allah is great; but Love is great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the woman-heart needs make atoning and wait:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has led him back to the crystal gate,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Together they entered there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Great Steep&rsquo;s Garden is musked today:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spices of Araby over it lay,<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
